            <p4>Welcome to my page! I'm a rising sophomore at New York University. 
                If I'm not studying for my computer science degree, I'm usually in a sunny room 
                sketching and painting or writing. I only started coding 7 months ago, and I am most 
                proficient in Python, and it's my favorite language so far because I don't worry about 
                semi-colons or private variables or declaring the datatypes of different data structures. 
                I'm an artist at heart, so computer science does not come easy to me, but I love the thrill of 
                discovering new ways to display ideas to other people, which is what drew me to pursue a career in 
                this field.</p4>
            <br>
            <p5>The lack of diversity in tech also drew me to pursue a career in computer science. I'm a strong advocate 
                of having fields of work that accurately represent the diverse and global population, and when 
                I found out how little minorities and women were represented in computer science, I felt a strong desire 
                to become a computer scientist to not only bring my creativity and build behind it a more technological 
                background, but also to create a more inclusive field of study for others after me.</p5>
            <br>
            <p6>I have gone through a lot in the short journey of my computer science career. While maybe it's too 
                early to be thinking about this, most, if not all, of my coding these past 7 months has been to complete 
                assignments for one to two people to view in my college courses. At Google, I would love to create 
                something that has meaning and purpose, where I can see my code impact individuals on a more 
                significant level. Instead of creating a program that sorts the numbers in an array, I would like 
                to see my code do something mroe impactful.</p6>
