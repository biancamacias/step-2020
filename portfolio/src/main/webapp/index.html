            <p4>Welcome to my page! I'm a rising sophomore at New York University. 
                If I'm not studying for my computer science degree, I'm usually in a sunny room 
                sketching and painting or writing. I only started coding 7 months ago, and I am most 
                proficient in Python, and it's my favorite language so far because I don't worry about 
                semi-colons or private variables or declaring the datatypes of different data structures. 
                I'm an artist at heart, so computer science does not come easy to me, but I love the thrill of 
                discovering new ways to display ideas to other people, which is what drew me to pursue a career in 
                this field.</p4>
            <br>
            <p5>The lack of diversity in tech also drew me to pursue a career in computer science. I'm a strong advocate 
                of having fields of work that accurately represent the diverse and global population, and when 
                I found out how little minorities and women were represented in computer science, I felt a strong desire 
                to become a computer scientist to not only bring my creativity and build behind it a more technological 
                background, but also to create a more inclusive field of study for others after me.</p5>
            <br>
            <p6>I have gone through a lot in the short journey of my computer science career. While maybe it's too 
                early to be thinking about this, most, if not all, of my coding these past 7 months has been to complete 
                assignments for one to two people to view in my college courses. At Google, I would love to create 
                something that has meaning and purpose, where I can see my code impact individuals on a more 
                significant level. Instead of creating a program that sorts the numbers in an array, I would like 
                to see my code do something mroe impactful.</p6>

            <p7>A project I'm really proud of is the project I created last summer during the Compuer Science 
                Summer Institute at Google in Los Angeles. I was having a lot of trouble understanding Python and 
                the back-end programming, but I really took care to pay attention and try and really understand more 
                of the front-end of the project. Style and aesthetic really resonated with me, and while my group 
                tried their best to help me understand Python, I was definitely someone that showed them a lot of the 
                front-end and how to style and organize a page using HTML and CSS. It was really fun and exciting, and 
                I'm glad I stuck with it because I made some amazing friends while I was there and connections that 
                I'm confident will stick with me for a long time.</p7>

            <p8>Taking pictures and documenting moments in time is really important to me. I think that 
                people forget how quickly certain things can pass, and sometimes a picture can perfectly 
                capture a moment that we never want to forget.</p8>

        <div class="blog-post">
            <p9>My hidden talent is that I'm really good at doing makeup. I rarely wear it, which is why it's surprising to 
                a lot of people, but growing up, I used to be a competitive dancer and actually learned to do my own hair 
                and makeup before I was ten years old. Since then, my skills have only gotten better, and I've actually been 
                paid every so often as a freelance artist for proms, dances, recitals, and weddings.</p9>
